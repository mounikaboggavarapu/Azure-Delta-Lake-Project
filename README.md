# Azure-Delta-Lake-Project

# **End-to-End Data Engineering Project with Azure Databricks and Delta Lake**

---

## **Project Overview**
This project showcases a comprehensive end-to-end data pipeline utilizing **Azure Databricks** and **Delta Lake**. It demonstrates data ingestion, transformation, and delivery to **Power BI** for visualization. The pipeline adheres to best practices in data engineering, leveraging **Delta Tables** for reliability, versioning, and schema management.

## **Features**
1. **Multi-Layer Data Architecture**:
   - **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw ingested data.
   - **Silver Layer**: Cleansed and enriched data for analytical processing.
   - **Gold Layer**: Aggregated, analytics-ready data in Delta format.

2. **Delta Tables**:
   - **ACID Transactions**: Reliable and consistent data updates.
   - **Versioning**: Track historical changes to data.
   - **Time Travel**: Query historical data states for auditing or debugging.
   - **Schema Evolution**: Adapt to changes in data structure seamlessly.

3. **Power BI Integration**:
   - Connected Delta Tables to Power BI for creating dynamic dashboards.
   - Provided real-time insights and analytics-ready data.

## **Data Collection and Ingestion**
The data pipeline begins with dynamic ingestion of raw data using **APIs**. The data is stored in the **Bronze layer** in **Parquet format** for efficient processing.

### **Steps:**
1. **Dynamic Ingestion**:
   - Batch processing using Python scripts and for-loops.
   - Error handling with conditional checks for consistency.

2. **Schema Validation**:
   - Enforced schema during ingestion to maintain data quality.
   - Supported schema evolution to accommodate changes in source data.

## **Data Transformation**
Transformations were performed in the **Silver layer** using **PySpark**:
- Extracted year, month, and day from timestamp columns.
- Removed null values and duplicates.
- Standardized column names for easier analysis.

---

## **Delta Tables and Advanced Features**
The **Gold layer** introduced **Delta Tables**, a powerful feature of Delta Lake:
- **Delta Log**: Tracks all changes (insert, update, delete) for full transparency.
- **ACID Guarantees**: Maintains data integrity and consistency.
- **Versioning and Time Travel**:
  - Restored previous versions of data for auditing.
  - Queried historical data states for debugging.
- **Partitioning**: Optimized queries for large datasets.

---

## **Connecting to Power BI**
Delta Tables were seamlessly integrated with **Power BI** for visualization:
1. **Partner Connect**: Used Azure Databricks' built-in feature to create connection files.
2. **Access Tokens**: Secured authentication using Databricks-generated tokens.
3. **Dashboards**: Built interactive dashboards for trend analysis and aggregated insights.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Azure Databricks**: For scalable data processing.
- **Delta Lake**: For advanced data management.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**: For cost-effective data storage.
- **PySpark**: For data transformations.
- **Power BI**: For visualization.
- **APIs**: For data ingestion.

---

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the capabilities of **Azure Databricks** and **Delta Lake** in creating reliable, scalable, and analytics-ready data pipelines. It emphasizes advanced features like **Delta Tables**, **versioning**, and **time travel**, delivering robust solutions for modern data engineering challenges.
